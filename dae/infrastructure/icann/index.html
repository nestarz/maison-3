<h1>Internet Domain Name System (DNS)</h1>

<p>
  The purpose of the DNS is to enable Internet applications and their users to
  name things that have to have a globally unique name. The obvious benefit is
  easily memorizable names for things like web pages and mailboxes, rather than
  long numbers or codes. Less obvious but equally important is the separation of
  the name of something from its location. Things can move to a totally
  different location in the network fully transparently, without changing their
  name. www.isoc.org can be on a computer in Virginia today and on another
  computer in Geneva tomorrow without anyone noticing.

  In order to achieve this separation, names must be translated into other
  identifiers which the applications use to communicate via the appropriate
  Internet protocols. Let’s look at what happens when you send a mail message to
  me at daniel.karrenberg@ripe.net. A mail server trying to deliver the message
  has to find out where mail for mailboxes at ‘ripe.net’ has to be sent. This is
  when the DNS comes into play.
