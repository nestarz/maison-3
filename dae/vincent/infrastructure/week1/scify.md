I thought about Evangelion, maybe you heard of it.

It's an anime, declined in a TV shows and movies.

To give a bit of a context, the story happened after a big impact in 2000
where an angel called Adam destroyed half of the humanity. 
After that an international military and science agency called Nerv was created to prevent any new attack by the angels.

In 2015, new angels were coming to attack the earth, and Nerv as the last rescue to humanity, took the charge of the battle with big mecha and with the help of a super intelligent automated system.

So my interest was the Magi System, this designed trio of supercomputers and bio-computers that was first designed for military and science purpose. now used to monitor the agency, the limits, of our relationships, and lives.

What interested me is the collateral and what seems a "lucky" effect of technologies. Like Internet systems, in a sense (facial reco ?). 

And maybe I want to look at those kinds of intelligent systems "reused" for practical reasons that erase centuries of traditions.


Global impact of automated decision making.
















I've thought about two movies, Train to Busan and Snowpiercer.
It's two movies set inside moving trains, and they seems the safest place on earth.

In the first, Train to Busan, outside is a total apocalypse where everyone has been infected by a mortal virus. In snowpiercer because of some kind of global warming, outside is so cold that if you are outside the train you die.

In Snowpiercer, the train becamed a kind of a society. And the linear architecture of the train made the linear society hierarchy appeared.

Also, the key point is the moving action.
