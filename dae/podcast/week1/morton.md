# Timothy Morton

Welcome our special guest, American philosopher and professor, Timothy Morten. 

He is Rita Shea Guffey, Chair in English, at Rice University. He had collaborations with artists and musicians such as Olafur Eliasson and Bjørk. He have wrote more than 10 books and 200 essays on philosophy, ecology, literature, music, art, architecture, design and food. 

His most recent book “Being Ecological (2018)” brings an intellectual and radical critique of how we know and relate to the world around us.

Nature is not natural and can never be naturalized — Graham Harman.

This quote is the first thing you can read from Timoty Morton blog. And this quote can be re-used to introduce him and his work. Like Graham Harman, he makes his living by researching and challenging the ontology of things, and objects. 

In his late work he challenge our relationship with Nature, being one of the idea our modern society have damaged. Why is everything we think we know about ecology wrong ? Is there any difference between humans and nature ? Does this mean we even have a future ?

Timothy Morton is here with us, please give him a warm welcome.

Stone age is a photograph.
Symphonie of different tones in phase or not, is a world.

How do you describe our modern relationship with nature.
where start the past, how can you describe the difference you are highlighting.
Is there one turning point ? 
Also, if you are hoping for a new turning point, 

Ambiguaty is a accurate signal.
Irony is a reality signal.

Quintecessence of the organic world, alive is to be chemical.

I understand, when you say "to be responsible" like a process, gather information, and then relate it to something you think it's linked. But maybe not, like you said, we might have been wrong linking . Do you have something to identify it's a link worth it.





Do we have to choose between dance and philosophy ? From what I understand, philosophy is a kind of naturalizing our senses into words, ideas, concepts. And dance is not, it's being them, our senses. It seems not compatible ?
You worked with Bjork, do you feel you and her are two kind of existence that can't overlap ? What prevent you from looking to the future and talk about it ?







Am I right to retain from your speaks, that you campaign to be more a tree, than looking to them, and try give them a name. 


You are on Twitter, you are in the research sphere, you are looking to a lot of trees,
you deal with maybe as much information as us, you evaluate them. 
To be more clear, maybe, what do you wait, you the citizen Morten, from this title information designer. For what kind of reasons, you would retweet our work on Twitter ? Is information desigenr and being ecological compatible ?


 to never be a global information designer, but more a local one. 

Well, it's maybe not a question to the philosopher, but more to the responsible man, what's your day life tool to AS an individual, to get it.
